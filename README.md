# C++ Mastering

This repository is for working along with the Udemy course [Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp).

## Build and run the code

CMake is used to build the project. To generate the buildsystem, first run the following from within the cpp-mastering directory:

`cmake -S . -B build`

Then, to build the project, run:

`cmake --build build/`

Now the main executable can be found in the build directory. To execute it, run:

`./build/main`
